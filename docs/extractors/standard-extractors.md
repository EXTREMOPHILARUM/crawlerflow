# Standard Extractor


InvanaBot allows users to extract information while it crawls through the webpages. You can specify multiple
extractors to a crawler, allowing you to organise the information you need into grouped/subdocument data.


All the extractors are available at `invana_bot.extractors`



## ParagraphsExtractor

Here is the configuration.

```yaml
spiders:
- spider_id: default_crawler
  extractors:
  - extractor_type: ParagraphsExtractor
    extractor_id: paragraphs_data
```

Here is the data extracted. This will return all the paragraphs as list.

```json
{
  "paragraphs_data" :  [
      "Here is the first paragraph",
      "Here is the second paragraph"
    ]
  
}
```


## TableContentExtractor


Here is the configuration.

```yaml
spiders:

```json
{  
   "tables_data":[  
      [ // table 1
         {

            "Country":"India",
            "Last Checked":"1 second ago"
         }

            "State": "New Delhi"
        }
      ]
   ]
} 
```

## MetaTagExtractor

`meta` element.

```yaml

    extractor_id: meta_tag_data
```

Here is the data extracted. This will return all the `<meta>` tags data as dictionary.

      "meta__viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1",
      "meta__referrer":"origin",
