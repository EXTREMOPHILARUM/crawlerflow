# InvanaBot

A spider cum data aggregation framework that can transform Websites, Feeds, APIs into Datasets with Crawl,
Transform and Index strategy; with configurations instead of code.
 
The framework comes with standard extractors that comes handy for most of the usecases. And gives you a way to 
write your own extraction strategy. The framework comes with integrations to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
 and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) by default, 
allowing you to save your data into your preferred database.

Some reasons you might want to use InvanaBot:

- No or least coding experience need, depending on the depth of your use-case.
- You can crawl a single site or traverse between multiple sites with just configuration.
- Data Storages like MongoDB and Elasticsearch are integrated already for use, Many more to join
- Built on top of Scrapy, so the core engine is Battle tested.

## Architecture

InvanaBot strategy relies on Crawl + Transform + Index Strategy, allowing user to traverse between 
multiple domains using just configuration..


## Requirements

Built with Python 3.6.x, **So python 2.7.x is not supported**. While the support might expand to
 more versions of Python 3x in near future. We are not planning on supporting 2.7
